Nomenclature for the Dynamic Circuit results on different IBM Hardwares for the work of Summer 2025.

4 options for run: use_midcircuit_measurement flag turned on/off with Dynamic Decoupling on/off.

###########
Example: DATA-ibm_pittsburgh_qft1_true_wDD
Meaning:
DATA-Hardware_algorithm and method_midcircuit on/off_ with/without Dynamic Decoupling
###########
DATA-ibm_fez_qft1_true_wDD_opt3_run2
Meaning:
DATA- "Hardware_algorithm and method" _ "midcircuit on/off" _ "with/without Dynamic Decoupling"_ "optimization level" _ "run number"

Note: in some experiments, optimization level for transpilatoin was changed to see if the fidelity changes. No differences noted.

Some experiments were run multiple times and the naming system for file has the run number.
